This repository contains different implementation approaches how to deploy docker-swarm to various environments respectively cloud-providers, using different tooling.

All implementation scenarios follow the sample voting app Docker has provided: [https://docs.docker.com/engine/getstarted-voting-app/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/getstarted-voting-app/) 

All scenarios are created in a generic, re-usable way, switching from deploying the voting-app to your services, should be pretty easy and straightforward.

**Caution:**
I am by no means an expert in this area. Working on the different scenarios primarily helped me to test the different approaches. Therefore any contribution, comment or PR is highly welcome.
