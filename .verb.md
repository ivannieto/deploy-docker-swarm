## Tools being used

Different tools have been used in the different scenarios, which also allows to compare the different approaches:
 
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
  - [Guest Additions for VirtualBox](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E36500_01/E36502/html/qs-guest-additions.html)
- [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) / [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/)
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)

Have a look at the README of the corresponding scenario to understand which of the tools are needed.
